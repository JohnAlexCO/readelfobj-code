David Anderson. September 2019.

The source files process various object formats without
reference to host system libraries other than libc.

It's intended that the resulting executables
will run in the host enviroment against any
suitable object file. The intent is to get
an overview of the various section contents
without, by default, looking into the sections.

Update 22 April 2023:
The code does not deal well with object files
that are corrupted with a zero e_shoff field
and other section-related fields non-zero.
Crashes and erroneous output are possible.

The code does not deal well with object files
that are corrupted with a zero e_phoff field
and other program-headeer fields non-zero.
Crashes and erroneous output are possible.
