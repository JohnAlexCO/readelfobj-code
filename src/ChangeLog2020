    * dwarf_debuglink.c: If shdr->gh_namestring is NULL
      (corrupted object file)
      do not try strcmp() on it!
    * readelfobj.c: If the target section name is NULL
      supply "<no-name!>" as a spelling.
    * sanitized.c: If the incoming string pointer is null
      supply that same spelling as in readelfobj.c

    * dwarf_load_elf_headers.c: Added a sanity check.
    * dwarf_peread.c: Removed debug printfs left in
      by accident and fixed an indent problem..
    * readobjpe.c: Removed a trailing whitespace character.
2020-06-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_peread.c: For pe32 one optional header
      field was not getting updated. ImageBase
      Now it is.
2020-06-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_peread.c: Now checks for a zero string pointer
      (from a fuzzed object) and avoids doing strdup(),
      providing a simple name "<sec name missing>"
      pointing out the problem..
    * readobjpe.c: Now calls sanitized() so that
      regardless of content the section name data will
      print something safe and recognizable (uri-style).
2020-02-11: David Anderson
    * readelfobj.c: Now check for some sh_link and sh_info
      errors.
2020-01-21: David Anderson
    * dwarfstring.c: Removed a trailing space character.
    * readobjmacho.c: Fixed an indentation error.
    * readelfobj.c(elf_print_symbols): Now prints the string
      length of the symbol name (it is often zero) and
      if zero prints  name-length  0: <no name> .
      The length of the symbol name is in bytes. If the
      name string contains European or Japanese or 
      multi-byte  UTF-8 characters those are translated
      to a uri-style output (as has been true all along)
      so the character count printed might vary somewhat
      from the byte count of the string.
      Then Changing spelling of empty name to <no-name>

    * dwarf_load_elf_headers.c(dwarf_elf_load_rela_32):
      Coverity Scan uncovered a memory leak in one
      case. CID 206524
